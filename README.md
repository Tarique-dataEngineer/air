#Airline Price Prediction


##Overview
This project focuses on predicting airline prices based on historical data. It involves data collection, preprocessing, model training, and prediction. The model is trained on historical pricing information to predict future airline prices.


##Acquire historical airline pricing data from Kaggle.
- Data Ingestion:
   Load the data into a Pandas DataFrame.

- Data Preprocessing:
   Handle missing values, outliers, and encode categorical variables.

- Model Training:
   Split data, choose a regression model, and train it.

- Model Evaluation:
   Assess model performance on the testing set.

- Save Model and Preprocessing:
   Serialize and save the trained model and preprocessing objects.

- Prediction:
    Load the model and preprocessing objects to make predictions.
